1.Situation: A fictious hospital’s medical director had a strategic decision to be made for 10 KPIs with a mission of delivering “Value at point of use” with the help of Predictive analysis. Our team chose Mortality rates as a KPI for designing a workflow and a predictive model.

2.Task: Major responsibility was to collect and generate data for Infant mortality, clean the data for selecting our variables for predicting the mortality rates, select the model/algorithm for the prediction, create a presentation/dashboard and present it to the medical director.

3.Actions: Using PubMed, Google Scholar, Kaggle and Mimic dataset we found data for Gestational dataset, (birthweight, socioeconomic status, birth defects, substance use, biomarkers) were the predictors. After performing exploratory data analysis, we used the Naïve baye’s and supporting vector machine algorithm and liner logistic regression for testing the accuracy of the dataset.

4.Results: Using the machine learning algorithms and regression analysis in MS excel we found (after training the variables with normal ranges) 85% accuracy was achieved for infant mortality based on the data.
